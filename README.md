## MemoFlash Application


#### The App

Welcome! MemoFlash is an application that allows students to create their own flashcards, organize them into decks, and 
test their knowledge.

#### My Interest

I want to make an application that can help me throughout university, and an app that helps me study for courses that  
require memorization is useful.


#### User Stories:  

As a user, I want to be able to... 
- create flashcards <<
- view all the cards in my deck <<
- test myself with the flashcards
- see my score after every flashcard session

Additional Features: (added at a later date)
- create decks to organize flashcards
- rename cards and decks
- remove cards from the deck
- remove decks I no longer need
- view all of my decks
- select deck to use for flashcard testing
