## MemoFlash Application


#### The App

Welcome! MemoFlash is an application that allows students to create their own flashcards, organize them into decks, and  
test their knowledge.

#### My Interest

I want to make an application that can help me throughout university, and an app that helps me study for courses that  
require memorization is useful.


#### User Stories:  

As a user, I want to be able to... 
- create flashcards
- organize the flashcards into titled decks
- remove cards from deck
- see my score after every flashcard session
