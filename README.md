## MemoFlash Application


#### The App

Welcome! MemoFlash is an application that allows the user to create their own flashcards and decks to test themselves 
with how well they retain knowledge. This application is useful for students, but learners of any kind can benefit from it.

#### My Interest

I want to make an application that can help me throughout university, and an app that helps me study for courses that  
require memorization is useful.


#### User Stories:  

As a user, I want to be able to... 
- create flashcards
- view all the cards in my deck
- test myself with the flashcards (be quizzed, see answers to incorrect questions and total score)
- remove flashcards from active deck

Additional Features: (possibly added at a later date)
- create decks to organize flashcards
- rename cards and decks
- remove decks I no longer need
- view all of my decks
- select deck to use for flashcard testing
