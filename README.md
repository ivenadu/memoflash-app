## Owlwise Application


#### The App

Welcome! Owlwise is an application that allows students to record learning goals, create their own flashcards, and   
write their own practice tests under timed exam conditions! These three modes of usage promote understanding of concept,  
application of knowledge, and preparation for actual examinations, respectively. While these modes may be used to a  
greater extent by students who are graded on their learning, any passionate learners can benefit from this application  
to see how well they understand and retain their knowledge!

#### My Interest

I want to make an application that has my learning goals, flashcards, and self-practice exams all in one place, where   
I can easily refer to the questions associated with particular learning goals. In this manner I can organise my learning  
and ensure that I am covering the course's important concepts. It will hopefully be a useful learning tool for me  
throughout my years as a student.


#### User Stories:  

As a user, I want to be able to... 
- create flashcards
- organize the flashcards into titled 'stacks' or folders
- color-code cards for personal preferences (e.g. according to difficulty)
- create comments associated with a particular flashcard
- select and de-select cards I want to practice on/ be in my practice exams
- have a countdown timer within the app that activates when I do practice exams
- match the learning goals to associated flashcard stacks
- see my score after every practice exam, along with which questions I got incorrect
